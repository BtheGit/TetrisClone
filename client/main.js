//todo make drop interval dynamic based on player progress and have score increased as
//a multiplier of that somehow
//todo, accelerate a fixed number of times with score multiplier increase as well

//TODO: improve wall kick handling (sometimes it kicks the piece two squares over without even rotating)

//todo Add in other player preview screen to show their action
//Is there a way to prerender canvases to return snapshots of the other players score?
//That would be way easier than rendering two more canvases concurrently

//TODO: Add in player names
